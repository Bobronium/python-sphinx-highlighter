# Python Sphinx Highlighter

An extension for VS Code that highlights reStructuredText in Python string literals.

> **Note:** This extension is still undergoing development and is unfinished (as you might have gathered from this being the README).
>
> If you want to contribute or use it yourself, run the development mode using the created build task. You'll need a recent Python version to run the associated build script.
